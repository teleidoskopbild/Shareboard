### Short-Info

Because I havenâ€™t registered a domain, the Mailgun functionality is limited.  
However, the project remains fully functional without sending emails.  
Keys can be manually shared as needed.

Alternatively, you can clone the project and set up your own Mailgun server,  
or remove the Mailgun functionality entirely if not needed.

**Please Note:**  
The project is hosted on an OnRender server, 
so it may take 60-90 Seconds to start initially, 
as the server might be in a "cold start" state.
